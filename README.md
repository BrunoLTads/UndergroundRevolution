# UndergroundRevolution
A mod which aims to add a new biome, the volcano. A new treat to your world that already destroyed tons of civilizatios throughout the century. Will you become one of them or destroy this godlike structure and it's followers? 

Things I have to do:
Bruning Zombie: code him to drop stuff, spawn and fix it's movement AI. It needs a desacceleration when falling, low on HP and when turning directions.
Rock Hidder/Rock Shadow: drop stuff, make sprite, let ai be able to jump and create spawn conditions.
Serpentinite: Fix sprite, world generation, tile merging and create items such as wand and hook.
Serpentinite gemstone block: add crafting and fix tile merging.
Burn't cape: add buffs and texture when players are wearing it.
Stone fragment projectile: add custom ai.
